       <h2>Professional Artist & Illustrator</h2>
       <p>I'm <strong>RioShuvo</strong>, an artist, designer & illustrator from Sweden. Making <strong>illustration.chibi character, painting, and mixing different pattern styles</strong> together is the best thing I know.

        I'm a curious person always up for trying new techniques and learning something new, so I often listen to the radio pretending to learn about science and space while I work and paint.
        I love collaborations and welcome anything big or small, so feel free to send me an email.</p>

      <p>Most of the artists capture the exact same pose from the given picture, but Riokiddo did amazing job to give it a unique and different view altogether picking only the required features of the given one. He also added some extra elements. That's really awesome. Highly recommended.</p>

        <P>It's was a great experience working with Riokiddo! The Chibi came out so nice and the most amazing part is how Shuvo bhai improvised and suggested me to put up a great output. Loved it. Thank you Riokiddo!</P>
